**Short bio**

I am working with Dr. Lane (USU) and Dr. Pasternack (UC Davis) to quantify the effects of geomorphological and topographic parameters on ecohydraulics and ecosystem functions. My research focuses on (1) developing a river archetype model that can accurately represent various geomorphological features observed in natural riverine systems and (2) assessing their impact on ecohydraulics and ecology. I received a Ph.D. from Purdue University in linking riverbed morphology, hydrodynamics, and hyporheic exchange processes.
